# Using Grover’s Algorithm for Factorization of Bi-primes

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of Grover’s algorithm to factorize bi-prime numbers. Grover's algorithm, known for its quadratic speedup in searching unsorted databases, can be adapted for factorization problems. Here, we apply Grover's algorithm to find the prime factors \( p \) and \( q \) of a given bi-prime number \( N = p \times q \).
