# Using Grover‚Äôs Algorithm for Factorization of Bi-primes

## Introduction

Factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors is a computationally challenging problem with significant implications for cryptography and information security. Traditional algorithms such as RSA encryption rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their primes for their security.

Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, offers a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for unstructured search problems. While primarily known for its application in database search, Grover's algorithm has been adapted to address the problem of integer factorization, particularly for bi-prime numbers.

This project demonstrates the implementation of Grover's algorithm using Qiskit, a quantum computing SDK for Python, to factorize bi-prime numbers into their prime components.

N.

Grover's Algorithm:

Initializes quantum registers in superposition.
Applies the multiplication oracle to search for factors of 
ùëÅ
N.
Implements Grover's diffusion operator to amplify the correct solution.
Execution
The project utilizes Qiskit's simulation capabilities (QASM simulator) to run Grover's algorithm.
Measurement results are collected and analyzed to determine the prime factors of bi-prime numbers such as 35, 115, and 893.
